    \begin{question}{\color{red} Strong Induction (slide invariant)}
    \textbf{Prove that every $\mathbf{n\geq2}$ can be expressed as a product of itself.}

    Let $P(n)$ be "$n=p_0 p_1 p_2 \cdots p_j$ where $p_0, p_1, p_2, \cdots, p_j$ are prime."
    We go by strong induction on $n$

    \underline{Base Case ($n=2$)}: $2=2$ and $2$ is a prime number. Thus, since it can be written as a product 
    of itself, which is prime, $P(2)$ is true. 

    \underline{Inductive Hypothesis:} Suppose that $P(l)$ is true for all
    $2 \leq l < k$ where $k \geq 2$.

    \underline{Inductive Step:} We go by cases:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $k$ is prime: If $k$ is prime, then there is no number smaller than $k$
        divides it. Thus, $k$ can be written as a product of itself which is prime and
        $P(k)$ holds if $k$ is prime. 
        \item $k$ is composite: If $k$ is composite, then it can be written as 
        $k = m \cdot n$ where $1 < m, n < k$. Since $m < k$ and $n < k$, then
        $$k = m \cdot n$$
        $$k = (p_0^m p_1^m p_2^m \cdots p_i^m)\cdot(p_0^n p_1^n p_2^n \cdots p_j^n) \ \text{(by Inductive Hypothesis)}$$

        A product of products is still a product, so $k$ can be written as a product of
        primes, thus $P(k)$ is true even when $k$ is composite
    \end{itemize}
    Since $P(k)$ is true for both cases of $k$ being prime or composite,
    we have proved the statement for all $n \geq 2$ by induction.
    \qed
